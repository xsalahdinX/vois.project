#### Devops Project proposal.


### Introduction
an interesting project aim to transform to DevOps methodolgy and Automation , imagine high impact project that will have a huge impact to the performance of an Application , has to be integrated builded tested and deployed in 3hours rather than 3 days. we need to create a EKS Elastic Kubernets Cluster in AWS to deploy our microservices App on it , then we should creat a reaible pipleline which should trigr the change in the code and begain the build , test and deploy . in otherwords a full qutomated DevOps Infinity Loop  


### an accedental scinario
i spend like day from the 3 days deadline revealling AZure pipline concepts and actual deployment the suddenly i discovered that they made a recent obligation and role for the usage of it , i have to communicate with them personally to give me the permisiion to use the pipline , and that was a huge wast of time as i hade 2 days remaining not 3 days , so i decided to percced my work on AWS Code pipline but i discovered that all the plugins that i have to work with and you mentioned in your manifast is not commpatable with aws and required a huge jobs and could be not functionable neghou , so i made some justification to catch the stituation
